Partitioning of the keys of the intermediate map output is controlled by the Partitioner. 
By hash function, key (or a subset of the key) is used to derive the partition. 
According to the key-value each mapper output is partitioned and records having the same key 
value go into the same partition (within each mapper), and then each partition is sent to a reducer.
 Partition class determines which partition a given (key, value) pair will go. Partition phase takes place after 
 map phase and before reduce phase. Lets move ahead with need of Hadoop Partitioner and if you face any difficulty 
 anywhere in Hadoop MapReduce tutorial, you can ask us in comments.
 
 Flow :-
PartitionerDriver.java -->PartitionerMapper.java--->MyPartitioner.java--->PartitionerReducer.java

In MyPartioner.java keys coming from PartitionerMapper having value "Delhi","mumbai" will go to same reducer say reducer0.
Key with Values with "Chennai" and Kolkata will go to Reducer 1;
else all data will go to Reducer2.
